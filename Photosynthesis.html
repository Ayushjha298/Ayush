    <h1><center> PHOTOSYNTHESIS</center></h1><br>
    <h2>What is phothosynthesis</h2>
    <p>The process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.</p>
    <h2>Types of phothosynthesis</h2>
    <p>There are two different types of photosynthesis:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Oxygenic photosynthesis</li>
        <li>Anoxygenic photosynthesis</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chlorophyll</h2>
    <p>Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue- and red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the plant appear green.</p>
    <h2>What is needed for Photosynthesis?</h2>
    <p>To make food, plants need not just one but all of the</p>

        <ul>
      <li>carbondioxide</li>
      <li>water</li>
      <li>sunlight</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Let’s take a look at how these are collected by plants.</p>
       <p>Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves. These pores are called stomata.
        Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves.
        Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.</p>
